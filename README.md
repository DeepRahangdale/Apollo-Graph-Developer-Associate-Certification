# Apollo Graph Developer - Associate Certification

Developers who obtain this certification possess a solid foundational knowledge of GraphQL and the Apollo tool suite to design a schema, run an Apollo Server 4, and perform queries with Apollo Client 3 on the frontend.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://lift-off-client-demo.netlify.app/).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 3 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.
- `final`: The final stage of both the server and client folders, with all of the steps and code completed!

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
